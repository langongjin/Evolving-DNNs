# Evolving-DNNs

This is the source code in the paper "Evolving Efficient Deep Neural Networks for Real-time Object Recognition"

In the experiments, we have the time-dependent (f_a) and time-independent (f(f_a, C_t)) experiments.

The following python code works for the time-dependent (f_a) experiments that start up by running run-object_time.py  
run-object_time.py  
visualize_plot_time.py  
load_images_2classRGB_time.py  
objectNEAT_time.py
